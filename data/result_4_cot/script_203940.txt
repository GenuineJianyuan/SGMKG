        "reason": "The output of Step1 is the 'Filtered NPP dataset', which is used as input in Step2 along with the 'Riau region boundary'. Step2 filters the NPP dataset based on the bounds of the Riau region, resulting in the 'NPP dataset within the Riau region'."

        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "Step2 outputs the 'NPP dataset within the Riau region', which is not directly used in Step3. However, Step3 uses the 'Riau region boundary' to center the map view, which is a necessary visualization step after filtering the data."

        "reason": "Step3 outputs a 'Map centered on the Riau region', which is a prerequisite for Step4. In Step4, the 'Riau region boundary' is added to the map for visualization, enhancing the context of the centered map."
