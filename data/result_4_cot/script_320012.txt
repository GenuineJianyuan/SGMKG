        "reason": "The output of Step1 is the 'Filtered Landsat image collection', which is necessary for Step2 to select the specific bands for compositing. Without the filtered collection from Step1, Step2 would not have the relevant images to choose bands from."

        "reason": "Step4 produces the 'Visualized composite image on the map', but this is not directly used in Step5. Instead, Step5 requires the 'Composite image' from Step3 as input to export it to Google Drive. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between Step4 and Step5 based on the output-input relationship."
