        "reason": "The output of Step2 is a 'Visualization of burned areas on the map', which is not directly used as input for Step3. However, Step3 requires the 'Burned area image' which is derived from the visualization process. Thus, the burned area image is conceptually linked to the output of Step2."

        "reason": "The output of Step3 is a 'Clipped burned area image within the study area boundaries', which is not directly used in Step4. However, Step4 uses the 'study area boundaries' to set the map center, which is relevant to the clipped image."

        "reason": "The output of Step4 is 'Map centered on the study area', which is used in Step5 to add layers to the map. Step5 requires the 'study area boundaries' and the 'clipped burned area image' to add these layers to the centered map."
