        "reason": "The output of Step2 is the 'Landsat image collection with scaled bands', which serves as the input for Step3. Step3 adds the scaled optical and thermal bands back to the Landsat images, resulting in a collection that includes these additional scaled bands."

        "reason": "The output of Step3 is the 'Landsat image collection with additional scaled bands', which is used as the input for Step4. Step4 visualizes the true color composite image using these scaled bands."

        "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4 is the 'True color composite image displayed on the map', which is independent of Step5. However, Step5 sets the map center to a specific location, which is necessary for displaying the true color composite image correctly on the map. Therefore, while there is no direct output-input relationship, Step5 enhances the visualization process initiated in Step4."
