In Step2, this filtered image collection is used to calculate the mean value of the NO2 column number density, resulting in a single image that represents the average NO2 levels."

        "reason": "The output of Step2 is the 'Mean image representing the average NO2 column number density', which is used as input in Step4. In Step4, this mean image is clipped to the administrative boundary defined in Step3, ensuring that the analysis is focused on the specific area of interest."
