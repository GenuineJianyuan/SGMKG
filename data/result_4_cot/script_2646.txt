        "reason": "The output of Step1 is a 'Cloud-free Sentinel-2 image', which is used as input in Step2. In Step2, the function 's2_rmcloud' is applied to filter the Sentinel-2 image collection, ensuring that only cloud-free images are selected for further analysis."

        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 is 'Filtered cloud-free Sentinel-2 images', which is relevant for Step3. Although Step3 does not directly use the output of Step2, it centers the map on the 'Region of interest', which is essential for visualizing the filtered images in the correct spatial context."

        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "Step3 outputs a 'Map with region of interest displayed', which helps in visualizing the area of interest but does not directly feed into Step4. However, Step4 calculates the 'Median composite image' from the 'Cloud-free Sentinel-2 images' filtered in Step2, which are relevant to the region of interest."
