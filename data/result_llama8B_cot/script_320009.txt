Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps.

Here is the list of connections in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Image converted to radians) is used as input for Step2 (Compute hillshade from terrain data) to convert the sun azimuth and elevation to radians."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Hillshade image) is not used as input for Step3 (Compute terrain measures from SRTM DEM). Instead, Step3 uses SRTM DEM image as input."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Terrain measures images for slope and aspect) is not used as input for Step4 (Set map center and add hillshade layer). Instead, Step4 uses center coordinates and hillshade layer as input."
  }
]
```

Note that there is no direct connection between Step1 and Step3, nor between Step2 and Step4, as the outputs of these steps are not used as inputs for the subsequent steps.
