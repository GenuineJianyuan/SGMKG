Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Feature collection of country boundaries) is used as input for Step2 (Feature collection containing only the Congo Republic feature) to filter the Congo Republic feature."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Feature collection containing only the Congo Republic feature) is not used as input for Step3 (Forest loss image from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset). Instead, Step3 loads a new dataset."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Forest loss image from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset) is used as input for Step4 (Image with only the 'loss' band selected) to select the loss band."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step4 (Image with only the 'loss' band selected) is used as input for Step5 (Statistics object containing the sum of forest loss pixels within the Congo Republic) along with the Congo Republic boundary to calculate the sum of forest loss pixels."
  }
]
```

Note that Step2 does not directly use the output of Step1, but instead uses the output of Step1 as input to filter the Congo Republic feature. Similarly, Step3 does not use the output of Step2, but instead loads a new dataset.
