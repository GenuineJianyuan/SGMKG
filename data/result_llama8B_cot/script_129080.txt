Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationship of these steps.

Here is the JSON array of connections:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The filtered Sentinel-2 image collection from Step1 is used as input for Step2, which further filters the images to get less cloudy granules."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The pre-filtered image collection with less cloudy granules from Step2 is used as input for Step3, which applies a cloud and cirrus masking function to the images."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The image collection with clouds and cirrus masked out from Step3 is used as input for Step4, which visualizes the RGB composite of the processed images over the Sharqiya Governorate boundary."
  }
]
```

The connections are based on the original sequence of steps, and the "Input" and "Output" relationships between each step. The "reason" field explains the connection between each pair of steps, describing the output-input relationship between the first step and the second step.
