Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1, 'nightlights2017', is used as input for Step2 to calculate the mean radiance of nighttime lights."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2, 'nightlights2017', is used as input for Step3 to clip the data to the boundary of Tanzania."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3, 'nightlights2017', is used as input for Step4 to select the average radiance band for visualization."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Image with only the 'avg_rad' band', is used as input for Step5 to add the layer to the map and visualize the results."
  }
]
```

Note that the relationships are based on the original sequence of steps and the input/output relationships described in each step's description, input, and output.
