Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (FeatureCollection of counties) is used as input for Step2 (Calculate county areas) to calculate the area of each county."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (FeatureCollection with added area property) is used as input for Step3 (Filter small counties) to filter out counties that are smaller than 3,000 square kilometers."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (FeatureCollection of smaller counties) is used as input for Step4 (Visualize smaller counties) to visualize the smaller counties on the map."
  }
]
```

The combination relationship of the steps is as follows:

* Step1 loads the TIGER boundaries dataset, and the output is used as input for Step2, which calculates the area of each county.
* Step2 calculates the area of each county and outputs a FeatureCollection with added area property, which is used as input for Step3, which filters out counties that are smaller than 3,000 square kilometers.
* Step3 filters out the small counties and outputs a FeatureCollection of smaller counties, which is used as input for Step4, which visualizes the smaller counties on the map.
