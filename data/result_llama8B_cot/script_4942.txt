Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered ImageCollection for the year 2017) is used as input for Step2 (Select water bodies land cover type) to select the land cover type representing water bodies."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Image with the selected land cover band) is used as input for Step3 (Mask out non-water land cover types) to mask out all land cover types except for water bodies."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Masked image with only water bodies visible) is used as input for Step4 (Calculate water pixels in Gansu region) to calculate the number of water pixels within the Gansu region."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step4 (Dictionary containing the count of water pixels) is used as input for Step5 (Visualize water bodies on map) to visualize the water bodies on the map."
  }
]
```

Note that the relationships are based on the original sequence of steps and the input/output relationships described in each step's description, input, and output.
