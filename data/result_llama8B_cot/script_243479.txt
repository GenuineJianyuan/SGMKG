Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered Landsat 8 Image Collection) is used as input for Step2 (Clip Landsat 8 imagery to ROI) to clip the filtered images to the region of interest (ROI)."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Clipped Landsat 8 Image Collection) is used as input for Step3 (Mask out cloud and cloud shadow pixels) to apply the cloud masking function to the clipped images."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Masked Landsat 8 Image Collection) is used as input for Step4 (Visualize processed Landsat 8 imagery) to visualize the processed images on the map."
  }
]
```

The relationships between the steps are as follows:

1. Step1 filters the Landsat 8 imagery based on a specific date range and cloud cover percentage, and the output is used as input for Step2 to clip the images to the region of interest (ROI).
2. Step2 clips the filtered images to the ROI, and the output is used as input for Step3 to apply the cloud masking function to the clipped images.
3. Step3 applies the cloud masking function to the clipped images, and the output is used as input for Step4 to visualize the processed images on the map.
