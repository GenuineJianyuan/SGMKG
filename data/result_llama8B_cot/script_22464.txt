Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Display the Peninsula region on the map' from Step1 is used as input to filter the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data for the Peninsula region in Step2."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered and processed Sentinel-2 composite image' from Step2 is used as input to visualize the composite image of the Peninsula region in Step3."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "No direct relationship exists between these steps."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Gaussian and Laplacian kernels for edge detection' from Step4 is used as input to apply the Gaussian kernel for edge detection on the composite image in Step5."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Enhanced image with Gaussian edge detection' from Step5 is used as input to apply the Laplacian kernel for edge detection on the enhanced image in Step6."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step6", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output 'Image with Laplacian edge detection' from Step6 is used as input to visualize the results of edge detection using both Gaussian and Laplacian kernels in Step7."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step7", "Step8"],
        "reason": "No direct relationship exists between these steps."
    }
]
```

Note that Steps 3 and 4, as well as Steps 7 and 8, do not have a direct relationship because there is no output-input connection between them.
