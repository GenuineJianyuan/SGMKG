Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Image with the 'occurrence' band selected) is used as input for Step2 (Visualization of the 'occurrence' band on the map)."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Image with the 'transition' band selected) is used as input for Step4 (Visualization of the 'transition' band on the map)."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Image with the 'transition' band selected) is used as input for Step5 (Calculate pixel area with transition classes)."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step5", "Step6"],
    "reason": "The output of Step5 (Image with pixel area and transition classes) is used as input for Step6 (Reduce pixel values within region of interest)."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step6", "Step7"],
    "reason": "The output of Step6 (Reduction results grouped by transition class values) is used as input for Step7 (Export 'transition' image to Google Drive)."
  }
]
```

Note that I only included the connections where the output of one step is used as input for another step.
