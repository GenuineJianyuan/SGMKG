Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered Landsat image collection) is used as input for Step2 (Landsat image collection for the year 2014) to filter the images for the year 2014."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered Landsat image collection) is used as input for Step3 (Landsat image collection for the year 2022) to filter the images for the year 2022."
  },

    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered Landsat image collection) is used as input for Step4 (Landsat image collection for the year 2018) to filter the images for the year 2018."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Landsat image collection for the year 2014) is used as input for Step5 (Image with NDSI band) to calculate the NDSI for each image in the collection."
