Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps and create a JSON array with the required format.

Here is the JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The filtered Sentinel-2 images for 'image_before' and 'image_after' are used as input to calculate the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) in Step2."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The NBR images 'image_NBR1' and 'image_NBR2' generated in Step2 are used as input to visualize the satellite images and NBR results on the map in Step3."
  }
]
```

In the first connection, Step1 filters Sentinel-2 images for a specific date range and location, and the output is used as input to calculate the NBR in Step2.

In the second connection, Step2 generates NBR images, and the output is used as input to visualize the satellite images and NBR results on the map in Step3.
