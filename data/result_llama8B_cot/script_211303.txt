Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Population data for 2011 within the Buffer2011 area', is used as input for Step2, 'Calculate Sum of Population for 2011', to calculate the sum of population within the Buffer2011 area for the year 2011."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Total population sum for 2011 within Buffer2011', is used as input for Step3, 'Export Population Data for 2011', to export the calculated population sum for 2011 to a CSV file."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Population data for 2013 within the Buffer2013 area', is used as input for Step5, 'Calculate Sum of Population for 2013', to calculate the sum of population within the Buffer2013 area for the year 2013."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5, 'Total population sum for 2013 within Buffer2013', is used as input for Step6, 'Export Population Data for 2013', to export the calculated population sum for 2013 to a CSV file."
    }
]
```

Note that the relationships only exist between steps that have a direct output-input relationship, as per the instructions.
