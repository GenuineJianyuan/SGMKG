Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered Landsat 8 ImageCollection for the specified time period) is used as input for Step2 (Create Cloud-Free Composite Image) to generate a cloud-free composite image."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Cloud-free composite image) is used as input for Step3 (Display Composite Images) to display the composite images on the map."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Cloud-free composite image) is used as input for Step4 (Clip Composite Image) to clip the cloud-free composite image to a specific study area polygon."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step4 (Clipped composite image) is used as input for Step5 (Display Clipped Composite Image) to display the clipped composite image on the map."
  }
]
```

Note that the relationships are based on the original sequence of the steps and the input/output relationships described in each step's description, input, and output.
