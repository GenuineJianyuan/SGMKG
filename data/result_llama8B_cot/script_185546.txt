Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps and create a JSON array with the required format.

Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Landsat 5 image with NDVI band added) is used as input for Step2 (Limit Training Data and Remap Classes) to limit the training data to a specific feature collection and remap the classes."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Remapped training data) is used as input for Step3 (Sample and Prepare Data) to sample the data and prepare it for training."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Sampled training sites) is used as input for Step4 (Train SVM Classifier) to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the sampled training data."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The output of Step4 (Trained SVM classifier) is used as input for Step5 (Classify Landsat Image) to classify the Landsat image using the trained SVM classifier."
  }
]
```

Note that the relationships are based on the original sequence of steps and the input/output relationships described in each step's description, input, and output.
