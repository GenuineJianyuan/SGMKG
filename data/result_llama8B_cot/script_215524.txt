Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Image object representing the SRTM elevation map) is used as input for Step2 (Define Region) to define the region to reduce within."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Geometry object representing the rectangular region) is used as input for Step3 (Reduce Image) to specify the region for reducing the image."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Dictionary containing the computed maximum pixel value) is used as input for Step4 (Print Result) to print the result to the console."
  }
]
```

In this JSON array, each object represents the connection between a pair of steps. The "relationship" key specifies the combination of steps, and the "reason" key explains the reason for the connection, including the output-input relationship between the two steps.
