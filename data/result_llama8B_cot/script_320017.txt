Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps and create the required JSON array.

Here is the JSON array representing the connections between the steps:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The remapped land cover image from Step1 is used as input for Step2 to calculate NDVI."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The NDVI image from Step2 is used as input for Step5 to combine factors for landslide detection."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The slope image from Step3 is used as input for Step4 to categorize slope."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The categorized slope image from Step4 is used as input for Step5 to combine factors for landslide detection."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step5"],
    "reason": "The remapped land cover image from Step1 is used as input for Step5 to combine factors for landslide detection."
  }
]
```

Note that the connections are based on the original sequence of the steps and the input/output relationships described in each step's "Step description", "Input", and "Output" elements.
