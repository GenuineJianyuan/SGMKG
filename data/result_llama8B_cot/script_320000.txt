Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps and create a JSON array with the required format.

Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The NDVI image computed in Step1 is used as input for the Canny Edge Detector algorithm in Step2."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The edge-detected image from Step2 is used as input to mask the image and remove areas with no edges in Step3."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The masked edge-detected image from Step3 is used as input to display the results on the map in Step4, along with the NDVI image."
  }
]
```

In this JSON array, each object represents a connection between two steps. The "relationship" key specifies the pair of steps, and the "reason" key explains the connection between them, including the output-input relationship between the two steps.
