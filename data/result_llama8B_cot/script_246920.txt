Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered Landsat image collection) is used as input for Step2 (Select Image with Least Cloud Cover) to select the image with the least cloud cover."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Image with the least cloud cover) is used as input for Step3 (Calculate NDWI) to calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for the selected image."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (NDWI image) is used as input for Step4 (Visualize NDWI on Map) to visualize the NDWI image on the map."
  }
]
```

The combination relationship of the steps is as follows:

* Step1 filters Landsat imagery based on location and date, and the output is used as input for Step2, which selects the image with the least cloud cover.
* Step2 selects the image with the least cloud cover, and the output is used as input for Step3, which calculates the NDWI for the selected image.
* Step3 calculates the NDWI, and the output is used as input for Step4, which visualizes the NDWI image on the map.
