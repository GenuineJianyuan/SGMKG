Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will analyze the combination relationship of these steps.

Here is the list of connections in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (ImageCollections s2_before, s2_inTime, s2_after) is used as input for Step2 to calculate NDVI and NBR bands for each Sentinel-2 image."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (ImageCollections ndvi_before, ndvi_in, ndvi_after) and Step2 (ImageCollections s2_before, s2_inTime, s2_after) are used as input for Step3 to calculate NBR bands for each Sentinel-2 image."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3 (ImageCollections nbr_before, nbr_in, nbr_after) is used as input for Step4 to visualize the NDVI and NBR bands on the map."
    }
]
```

The combination relationship of these steps is as follows:

1. Step1 retrieves Sentinel-2 images for three different time periods, and the output is used as input for Step2 to calculate NDVI and NBR bands for each Sentinel-2 image.
2. Step2 calculates NDVI and NBR bands for each Sentinel-2 image, and the output is used as input for Step3 to calculate NBR bands for each Sentinel-2 image.
3. Step3 calculates NBR bands for each Sentinel-2 image, and the output is used as input for Step4 to visualize the NDVI and NBR bands on the map.

Note that the relationship only exists if the output and its matched input exist.
