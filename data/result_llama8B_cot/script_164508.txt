Based on the provided JSON data, I will analyze the combination relationship of the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
    "reason": "The output of Step1 (Filtered feature collection representing the boundary of Italy) is used as input in Step2 (Import and Filter NO2 Values) to filter the NO2 values to the extent of Italy."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
    "reason": "The output of Step2 (Filtered image collection containing NO2 values for the specified months) is used as input in Step3 (Calculate Average NO2 Values) to filter the NO2 image collection for the years 2019 and 2020."
  },
  {
    "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
    "reason": "The output of Step3 (Average NO2 image for 2019 and 2020 clipped to Italy) is used as input in Step4 (Visualize NO2 Values) to visualize the NO2 values on the map."
  }
]
```

Note that the relationship only exists if the output and its matched input exist.
