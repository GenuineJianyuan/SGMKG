        "reason": "The output of Step3 is a 'Clipped burned area image within the study area boundaries', which is not directly used in Step4. However, Step4 uses the 'study area boundaries' to set the map center, which is relevant to the visualization context established in the previous steps."

In Step6, the 'Clipped burned area image' is exported to Google Drive as a GeoTIFF file, which is a final step that does not directly depend on the output of Step5 but completes the workflow by saving the processed data."
