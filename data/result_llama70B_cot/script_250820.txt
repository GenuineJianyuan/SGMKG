Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'image' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to reduce the image within the specified region."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'poly' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to define the region of interest for the reduction."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'max' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to print the computed maximum pixel value to the console."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation for each connection:

1. Step1 and Step3: The output 'image' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to reduce the image within the specified region.
2. Step2 and Step3: The output 'poly' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to define the region of interest for the reduction.
3. Step3 and Step4: The output 'max' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to print the computed maximum pixel value to the console.

These connections illustrate the flow of data between the steps, highlighting how the outputs from one step are used as inputs in subsequent steps.
