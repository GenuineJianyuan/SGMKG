Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the JSON array listing the connections:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered image collection' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to create mosaics for radar images before and after the flood event."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Mosaic images before and after the flood event' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the difference in radar intensities between before and after the flood event."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Difference in radar intensities' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to apply a threshold to identify flooded areas based on the difference in radar intensities."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Binary image indicating flooded areas' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to visualize the analysis results on a map, along with other inputs from previous steps."
    }
]
```

These connections are based on the output-input relationships between each pair of steps, as described in the "Step description" and "Input"/"Output" elements.
