Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Loaded image variable \'image\'' from Step1 is used as input in Step4 for sampling pixel values."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Defined bands variable \'bands\'' from Step2 is used as input in Step5 for training the SVM classifier."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'FeatureCollection of training polygons variable \'polygons\'' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 for sampling pixel values."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training data variable \'training\'' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 for training the SVM classifier."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained classifier variable \'trained\'' from Step5 is used as input in Step6 for classifying the image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Loaded image variable \'image\'' from Step1 is used as input in Step6 for classifying the image."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
