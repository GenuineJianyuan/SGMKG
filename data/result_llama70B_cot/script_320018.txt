Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the JSON array listing the connections:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (Loaded Landsat 5 images) is used as input in Step2 to compute NDVI."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (NDVI values for both Landsat images) is used as input in Step3 to calculate the NDVI difference."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3 (NDVI difference between the two Landsat images) is used as input in Step4 to apply the land mask."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4 (Masked NDVI difference with non-land areas removed) is used as input in Step5 to display on the map."
    }
]
```

These connections are based on the output-input relationships between each pair of steps, as described in the "Step description" and "Input"/"Output" elements.
