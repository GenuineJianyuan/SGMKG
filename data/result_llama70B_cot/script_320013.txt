Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Loaded Landsat image' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to display the original Landsat image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Updated display settings' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to display the original Landsat image with defined visualization parameters."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Original Landsat image' from Step1 is used as input in Step4 to resample the Landsat image using bicubic interpolation."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Resampled Landsat image using bicubic interpolation' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to display the resampled Landsat image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Updated display settings' from Step2 is used as input in Step5 to display the resampled Landsat image with the same visualization parameters as the original image."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step3: The loaded Landsat image is used to display the original image.
2. Step2 and Step3: The updated display settings are used to visualize the original Landsat image.
3. Step1 and Step4: The original Landsat image is resampled using bicubic interpolation.
4. Step4 and Step5: The resampled Landsat image is displayed on the map.
5. Step2 and Step5: The same visualization parameters are used to display the resampled Landsat image.
