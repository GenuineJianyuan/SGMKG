Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Composite image with the mean methane concentration band', is used as input in Step3 to sample the methane composite within the area of interest."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Area of interest polygon geometry', is used as input in Step3 to define the area of interest for sampling the methane composite."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'FeatureCollection with latitude, longitude, and methane concentration properties', is used as input in Step4 to calculate the global mean and standard deviation of methane concentrations."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Global mean and standard deviation of methane concentrations', is used as input in Step5 to perform IDW interpolation to estimate methane concentrations."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'FeatureCollection with latitude, longitude, and methane concentration properties', is used as input in Step5 to perform IDW interpolation to estimate methane concentrations."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5, 'Interpolated methane concentrations', is used as input in Step6 to visualize the methane data on a map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Composite image with the mean methane concentration band', is used as input in Step6 to visualize the original methane data on a map."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
