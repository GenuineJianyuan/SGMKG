Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the JSON array listing the connections:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Loaded Sentinel-2 image collection' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to filter the imagery."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Sentinel-2 image collection' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the NDVI."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Sentinel-2 image collection with NDVI band added' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to sample training data."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'feature collection' from Step1 is used as input in Step4 to sample training data."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training data for the classifier' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to train the Random Forest classifier."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained Random Forest classifier' from Step5 is used as input in Step6 to classify the imagery."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Sentinel-2 image collection with NDVI band added' from Step3 is used as input in Step6 to classify the imagery."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the steps.
