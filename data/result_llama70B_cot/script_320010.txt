Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDVI image' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 for applying the Canny edge detector algorithm."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Canny edge detection result' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 for applying the Hough Transform algorithm."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Original image' from Step1 is used as input in Step4 for displaying the results on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Canny edge detection result' from Step2 is used as input in Step4 for displaying the results on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Hough transform result' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 for displaying the results on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the NDVI image output from Step1 is used as input in Step2 for applying the Canny edge detector algorithm.
2. Step2 and Step3 are connected because the Canny edge detection result output from Step2 is used as input in Step3 for applying the Hough Transform algorithm.
3. Step1 and Step4 are connected because the original image output from Step1 is used as input in Step4 for displaying the results on the map.
4. Step2 and Step4 are connected because the Canny edge detection result output from Step2 is used as input in Step4 for displaying the results on the map.
5. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the Hough transform result output from Step3 is used as input in Step4 for displaying the results on the map.
