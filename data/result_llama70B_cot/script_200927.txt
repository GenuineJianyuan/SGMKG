Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (variables 'lat' and 'lon' storing the latitude and longitude values) is used as input in Step2 to create a point geometry at the specified latitude and longitude."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (point geometry representing the location) is used as input in Step3 to add the point geometry to the map for visualization."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (latitude and longitude values) is used as input in Step7 to center the map on the specified latitude and longitude."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4 (filtered image collection dataset) is used as input in Step5 to select the 'hourlyPrecipRate' band from the dataset."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step8"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5 (image collection dataset with only the 'hourlyPrecipRate' band) is used as input in Step8 to add the precipitation data to the map for visualization."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step6", "Step8"],
        "reason": "The output of Step6 (visualization parameters for the precipitation data) is used as input in Step8 to display the precipitation data on the map using the defined visualization parameters."
    }
]
```

These connections represent the relationships between the steps, where the output of one step is used as input in another step.
