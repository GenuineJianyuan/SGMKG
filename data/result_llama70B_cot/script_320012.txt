Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Landsat image collection' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to select the bands for compositing."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Selected bands for compositing' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to composite the images."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Composite image' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to visualize the composite image."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Composite image' from Step3 is used as input in Step5 to export the composite image to Google Drive."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step3: The filtered Landsat image collection from Step1 is used to select the bands for compositing in Step3.
2. Step2 and Step3: The selected bands from Step2 are used to composite the images in Step3.
3. Step3 and Step4: The composite image from Step3 is used to visualize the composite image in Step4.
4. Step3 and Step5: The composite image from Step3 is used to export the composite image to Google Drive in Step5.

Note that there is no direct connection between Step1 and Step2, as they operate on different inputs (Landsat image collection and band names, respectively). Similarly, there is no direct connection between Step4 and Step5, as they operate on the same input (composite image) but for different purposes (visualization and export, respectively).
