Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Landsat 7 imagery with NDVI band added', is used as input in Step2 to build a quality mosaic using the NDVI values."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Quality mosaic image based on NDVI values', is used as input in Step3 to visualize the greenest pixels from the quality mosaic."
    }
]
```

Here's the explanation:

1. Step1 loads Landsat 7 imagery for the year 2000 and calculates the NDVI, producing an output of "Landsat 7 imagery with NDVI band added".
2. Step2 takes this output as input and builds a quality mosaic using the NDVI values, producing an output of "Quality mosaic image based on NDVI values".
3. Step3 takes the output of Step2 as input and visualizes the greenest pixels from the quality mosaic, producing a final output of "Visualization of the greenest pixels on the map".

The relationships between the steps are based on the output-input connections, where the output of one step is used as input in the next step.
