Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the JSON array listing the connections:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Visualization of the Kajiado boundary on the map', is used as a reference to center the map in Step3, which visualizes the precipitation data."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Filtered and sorted image collection with precipitation band selected', is used as input in Step3 to visualize the precipitation data on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Visualization of precipitation data on the map', is used as input in Step4 to export the colorized precipitation image to Google Drive."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step3: The visualization of the Kajiado boundary on the map (output of Step1) is used as a reference to center the map in Step3, which visualizes the precipitation data.
2. Step2 and Step3: The filtered and sorted image collection with the precipitation band selected (output of Step2) is used as input in Step3 to visualize the precipitation data on the map.
3. Step3 and Step4: The visualization of the precipitation data on the map (output of Step3) is used as input in Step4 to export the colorized precipitation image to Google Drive.
