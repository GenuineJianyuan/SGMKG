Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Sentinel-2 image collection', is used as input in Step2 for cloud masking."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Cloud-masked Sentinel-2 image collection', is used as input in Step3 for calculating NDCI."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'NDCI image collection', is used as input in Step4 for visualization on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Sentinel-2 image collection', is used to generate the RGB composite image, which is an input in Step4 for visualization on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Cloud-masked Sentinel-2 image collection', is used as input in Step4 for visualization on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the filtered Sentinel-2 image collection output from Step1 is used as input in Step2 for cloud masking.
2. Step2 and Step3 are connected because the cloud-masked Sentinel-2 image collection output from Step2 is used as input in Step3 for calculating NDCI.
3. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the NDCI image collection output from Step3 is used as input in Step4 for visualization on the map.
4. Step1 and Step4 are connected because the filtered Sentinel-2 image collection output from Step1 is used to generate the RGB composite image, which is an input in Step4 for visualization on the map.
5. Step2 and Step4 are connected because the cloud-masked Sentinel-2 image collection output from Step2 is used as input in Step4 for visualization on the map.
