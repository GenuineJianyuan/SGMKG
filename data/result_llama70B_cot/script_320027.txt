Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Feature collection of uploaded samples' from Step1 is used as input 'Sample points' in Step4."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Landsat 8 image collection filtered by time and location' from Step2 is used as input 'Landsat 8 image collection' in Step3."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Median Landsat 8 image' from Step3 is used as input 'Landsat image bands' in Step4."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training data with spectral values for each sample point' from Step4 is used as input 'Training data' in Step5."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained random forest classifier' from Step5 is used as input 'Trained classifier' in Step6."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Median Landsat 8 image' from Step3 is used as input 'Landsat image bands' in Step6."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step6", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output 'Classified image' from Step6 is used as input 'Classified image' in Step7."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step6", "Step8"],
        "reason": "The output 'Classified image' from Step6 is used as input 'Classified image' in Step8."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step8"],
        "reason": "The output 'Iowa geometry' from Step2 is used as input 'Iowa geometry' in Step8."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
