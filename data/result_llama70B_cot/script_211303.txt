Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Population data for 2011 within the Buffer2011 area', is used as input in Step2 to calculate the sum of population within the Buffer2011 area."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Total population sum for 2011 within Buffer2011', is used as input in Step3 to export the calculated population sum to a CSV file."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Population data for 2013 within the Buffer2013 area', is used as input in Step5 to calculate the sum of population within the Buffer2013 area."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5, 'Total population sum for 2013 within Buffer2013', is used as input in Step6 to export the calculated population sum to a CSV file."
    }
]
```

These connections are based on the output-input relationships between the steps, as described in the "Step description", "Input", and "Output" elements.
