Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Landsat 5 image with NDVI band added (L5wNDVI)' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to sample the data and prepare it for training."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Remapped training data (training)' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to sample the data and prepare it for training."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Sampled training sites (training_sites)' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to train the SVM classifier."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained SVM classifier (trained)' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to classify the Landsat image."
    }
]
```

These connections are based on the output-input relationships between the steps, as described in the "Step description" and "Input"/"Output" elements.
