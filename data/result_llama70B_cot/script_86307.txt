Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered image collection based on the selected band and time period', is used as input in Step2 to calculate the mean value."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Mean image representing the average NO2 column number density', is used as input in Step4 to clip the image to the administrative boundary."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Loaded table of state boundaries', is used as input in Step4 to clip the image to the administrative boundary."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Clipped image within the specified administrative boundary', is used as input in Step5 to visualize the image on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Clipped image within the specified administrative boundary', is used as input in Step6 to export the image to Google Drive."
    }
]
```

These connections illustrate the flow of data between the steps, highlighting how the output of one step is used as input in the subsequent step.
