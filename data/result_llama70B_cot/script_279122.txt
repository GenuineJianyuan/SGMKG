Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the output in the required JSON array format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Sentinel-2 image (SE2_2019)' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Image with NDVI band (SE2_2019WithNDVI)' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to sample training data from labeled examples."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Image with NDVI band (SE2_2019WithNDVI)' from Step2 is used as input in Step5 to classify the image into different land cover classes."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training data (training)' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to train a Random Forest classifier."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained Random Forest classifier (classifier)' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to classify the image into different land cover classes."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
