Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will analyze the combination relationship between the steps and list the connections using a JSON array.

Here is the output:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Image with the 'occurrence' band selected', is used as input in Step2 to visualize the 'occurrence' band on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Image with the 'transition' band selected', is used as input in Step4 to visualize the 'transition' band on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Image with the 'transition' band selected', is used as input in Step5 to calculate the pixel area with transition classes."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5, 'Image with pixel area and transition classes', is used as input in Step6 to reduce the pixel values within the region of interest."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Image with the 'transition' band selected', is used as input in Step7 to export the 'transition' image to Google Drive."
    }
]
```

I have identified the connections between the steps based on the input-output relationships and the step descriptions. The reasons provided explain the output-input relationships between each pair of connected steps.
