Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will analyze the combination relationship between the steps and list the connections using a JSON array.

Here is the output:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered and adjusted MODIS landcover image' from Step1 is used as input in Step4 to create a training dataset by sampling the stacked images."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Landsat data collection' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to create a Landsat composite image for visualization."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Landsat data collection' from Step2 is used as input in Step4 to create a training dataset by sampling the stacked images."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Landsat composite image' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to create a training dataset by sampling the stacked images."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training dataset for classifier' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to train a classifier using the training data."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained classifier' from Step5 is used as input in Step6 to apply the trained classifier to the Landsat composite."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Landsat composite image' from Step3 is used as input in Step6 to apply the trained classifier to the Landsat composite."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step6", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output 'Classified and clipped landcover image' from Step6 is used as input in Step7 to visualize the upsampled landcover image."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
