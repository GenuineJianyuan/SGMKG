Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the JSON array listing the connections:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Landsat imagery dataset', is used as input in Step2 to apply scaling factors to the optical and thermal bands."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Landsat imagery with scaled optical and thermal bands', is used as input in Step3 to visualize the false color composite image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Landsat imagery with scaled optical and thermal bands', is used as input in Step4 to visualize the thermal band image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Landsat imagery with scaled optical and thermal bands', is used as input in Step5 to identify and visualize hotspots in the thermal band."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'False color composite image layer on the map', is displayed on the map, which is then set up with specific options in Step6."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Thermal band image layer on the map', is displayed on the map, which is then set up with specific options in Step6."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5, 'Hotspot visualization layer on the map', is displayed on the map, which is then set up with specific options in Step6."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the steps.
