Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'NDVI image', is used as input in Step2 to apply the Canny Edge Detector algorithm."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Edge-detected image', is used as input in Step3 to mask the image and remove areas with no edges."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Edge-detected image', is used as input in Step4 to display the results, although it is masked first in Step3."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'NDVI image', is used as input in Step4 to display the results along with the masked edge-detected image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Masked edge-detected image', is used as input in Step4 to display the results."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the NDVI image output from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to apply the Canny Edge Detector algorithm.
2. Step2 and Step3 are connected because the edge-detected image output from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to mask the image and remove areas with no edges.
3. Step2 and Step4 are connected because the edge-detected image output from Step2 is used as input in Step4 to display the results, although it is masked first in Step3.
4. Step1 and Step4 are connected because the NDVI image output from Step1 is used as input in Step4 to display the results along with the masked edge-detected image.
5. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the masked edge-detected image output from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to display the results.
