Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow step by step and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Landsat 8 TOA image collection' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to filter the least cloudy image in 2015."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered image collection with the least cloudy image in 2015' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the NDVI."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDVI image' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to display the NDVI image on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation for each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2: The output from Step1 (Landsat 8 TOA image collection) is used as input in Step2 to filter the least cloudy image in 2015.
2. Step2 and Step3: The output from Step2 (Filtered image collection with the least cloudy image in 2015) is used as input in Step3 to calculate the NDVI.
3. Step3 and Step4: The output from Step3 (NDVI image) is used as input in Step4 to display the NDVI image on the map.

These connections exist because the output from one step is used as input in the subsequent step, ensuring a seamless workflow in the geospatial analysis model.
