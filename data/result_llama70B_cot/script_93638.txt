Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Thresholded image layer on the map', is used as input in Step2, 'Thresholded image', for edge detection using the Canny edge detector."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Edge detection layer on the map', is used as input in Step4, 'Edge detection result', for convolution with the ring kernel."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Ring kernel for convolution', is used as input in Step4, 'Ring kernel', for convolution with the edge detection result."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the thresholded image layer produced in Step1 is used as input for edge detection in Step2.
2. Step2 and Step4 are connected because the edge detection layer produced in Step2 is used as input for convolution with the ring kernel in Step4.
3. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the ring kernel produced in Step3 is used as input for convolution with the edge detection result in Step4.

Note that there is no direct connection between Step1 and Step3, or Step1 and Step4, because the outputs of Step1 are not directly used as inputs in these steps. Similarly, there is no direct connection between Step2 and Step3, because the outputs of Step2 are not directly used as inputs in Step3.
