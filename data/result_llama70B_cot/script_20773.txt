Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the JSON array listing the connections:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Sentinel-2 image on the map with specified visualization parameters' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to sample regions from the Sentinel-2 image based on the training dataset."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Combined training dataset containing all land cover classes' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to sample regions from the Sentinel-2 image based on the training dataset."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training set for model training' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to train a classification model using the training set."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained classification model' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to classify the Sentinel-2 image into different land cover classes using the trained model."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Sentinel-2 image on the map with specified visualization parameters' from Step1 is used as input in Step5 to classify the Sentinel-2 image into different land cover classes using the trained model."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Classified image with land cover classes' from Step5 is used as input in Step6 to display the classified image on the map with a color palette representing different land cover classes."
    }
]
```

These connections illustrate the flow of data between the steps, highlighting how the outputs from one step are used as inputs in subsequent steps.
