Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Global Forest Change dataset' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to calculate the tree cover area for the year 2000."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'GTOPO30 elevation data' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the tree cover area within specific altitude ranges."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Birdlife 2017 sample dataset' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the tree cover area within specific altitude ranges."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'tree cover area for the year 2000' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the tree cover area within specific altitude ranges."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Feature containing the object ID, SIS ID, and tree cover area for each sample image' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to export the calculated tree cover areas to a CSV file."
    }
]
```

These connections are based on the input-output relationships between the steps, as described in the original sequence and the "Step description", "Input", and "Output" elements.
