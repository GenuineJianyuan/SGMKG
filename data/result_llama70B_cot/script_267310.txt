Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will analyze the combination relationship between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to visualize the clipped DEM on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the aspect from the DEM."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step4 to calculate the hillshade from the DEM."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step5 to calculate the slope from the DEM."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step6 to calculate various terrain products from the DEM."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step7 to fill minima in the DEM."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step8"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clipped SRTM elevation data within the specified area' from Step1 is used as input in Step8 to compute the mean elevation within the specified area."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step7", "Step8"],
        "reason": "The output 'DEM image with filled minima' from Step7 is used as input in Step8 to compute the mean elevation within the specified area."
    }
]
```

Note that I only connected steps where the output of one step is used as input in another step.
