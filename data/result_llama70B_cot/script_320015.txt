Here is the JSON array representing the combination relationships between the steps:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Geometry object representing the boundary of Beijing' from Step1 is used as input 'Geographic boundary' in Step5."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
