Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Mosaic image clipped to the region of interest', is used as input in Step2 for band selection."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Image with selected bands', is used as input in Step3 to calculate the mean values of each band."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Mean values of each band as an image', is used as input in Step4 to perform Principal Component Analysis."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Image containing the first 13 principal components', is used as input in Step5 to visualize the first three principal components on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 produces a mosaic image, which is then used in Step2 for band selection.
2. The output of Step2 (image with selected bands) is used in Step3 to calculate the mean values of each band.
3. The mean values output from Step3 are used in Step4 to perform Principal Component Analysis.
4. The principal components image output from Step4 is used in Step5 to visualize the first three principal components on the map.

These connections are based on the input-output relationships between each step, as described in the original JSON summarization.
