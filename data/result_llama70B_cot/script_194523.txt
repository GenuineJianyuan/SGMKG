Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Landsat 8 ImageCollection (Data1)' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to create a composite image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Composite image (Data_Collection)' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDWI image (NDWI)' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to mask out non-water areas in the composite image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Composite image (Data_Collection)' from Step2 is used as input in Step4 to mask out non-water areas."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDWI image (NDWI)' from Step3 is used as input in Step5 to classify water and ice based on elevation from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM)."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Masked composite image (Collection_mask)' from Step4 is used as input in Step6 to visualize the data layers on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDWI image (water)' from Step3 is used as input in Step6 to visualize the data layers on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Classified ice image (ice)' from Step5 is used as input in Step6 to visualize the data layers on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDWI image (water)' from Step3 is used as input in Step7 to export the water image to Google Drive."
    }
