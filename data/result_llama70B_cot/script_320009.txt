Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Image converted to radians' from Step1 is used as an input in Step2 to compute hillshade from terrain data."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Terrain measures images for slope and aspect' from Step3 is used as an input in Step2 to compute hillshade from terrain data."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Hillshade image' from Step2 is used as an input in Step4 to set the map center and add the hillshade layer."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2: The output from Step1 (Image converted to radians) is used as an input in Step2 to compute hillshade from terrain data.
2. Step3 and Step2: The output from Step3 (Terrain measures images for slope and aspect) is used as an input in Step2 to compute hillshade from terrain data.
3. Step2 and Step4: The output from Step2 (Hillshade image) is used as an input in Step4 to set the map center and add the hillshade layer.

Note that there is no direct connection between Step1 and Step3, or between Step3 and Step4, as the outputs from these steps are not used as inputs in each other.
