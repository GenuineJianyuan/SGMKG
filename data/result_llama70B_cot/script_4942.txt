Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered ImageCollection for the year 2017', is used as input in Step2 to select the land cover type representing water bodies."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Image with the selected land cover band', is used as input in Step3 to mask out non-water land cover types."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Masked image with only water bodies visible', is used as input in Step4 to calculate the number of water pixels within the Gansu region."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Masked image with only water bodies visible', is used as input in Step5 to visualize the water bodies on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 filters the MODIS dataset for 2017, and the output is used in Step2 to select the land cover type representing water bodies.
2. Step2 selects the land cover type, and the output is used in Step3 to mask out non-water land cover types.
3. Step3 masks out non-water land cover types, and the output is used in Step4 to calculate the number of water pixels within the Gansu region.
4. Step3 also provides the output used in Step5 to visualize the water bodies on the map.

Note that there is no direct connection between Step4 and Step5, as they operate on different aspects of the data (pixel count and visualization, respectively).
