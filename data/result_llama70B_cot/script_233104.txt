Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Sentinel-1 GRD image collection with VV and VH bands selected', is used as input in Step2 to calculate the RVI4S1 index."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'RVI4S1 image with visualization parameters', is not directly used in Step3. However, the calculateRVI4S1 function defined in Step2 is applied to each image in the Sentinel-1 GRD collection in Step3."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Sentinel-1 GRD image collection with VV and VH bands selected', is used as input in Step3 to map the RVI4S1 calculation function over the image collection."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Collection of RVI4S1 images', is used as input in Step4 to display the RVI4S1 image on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the filtered image collection from Step1 is used to calculate the RVI4S1 index in Step2.
2. Step2 and Step3 are connected because the calculateRVI4S1 function defined in Step2 is applied to each image in the collection in Step3.
3. Step1 and Step3 are connected because the filtered image collection from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to map the RVI4S1 calculation function.
4. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the collection of RVI4S1 images from Step3 is used to display the RVI4S1 image on the map in Step4.
