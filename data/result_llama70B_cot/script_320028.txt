Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'India region geometry variable (indiaRegion)' from Step1 is not used as input in Step2. Therefore, there is no connection between Step1 and Step2."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'MODIS land cover image collection variable (modisLandCover)' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to select the 'LC_Type1' band."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Land cover image variable (landCover)' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to identify corn areas."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Binary image indicating corn areas (cornAreas)' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to visualize corn areas on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Binary image indicating corn areas (cornAreas)' from Step4 is used as input in Step6 to calculate the total corn field area."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'India region geometry variable (indiaRegion)' from Step1 is used as input in Step6 to calculate the total corn field area."
    }
]
```

Note that there is no connection between Step1 and Step2 because the output from Step1 is not used as input in Step2.
