Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the output:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'nightlights2017' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to calculate the mean radiance."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'nightlights2017' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to clip the image to the Tanzania boundary."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'nightlights2017' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to select the average radiance band."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Image with only the avg_rad band' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to add the layer to the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2: The output 'nightlights2017' from Step1 (filtering image collection) is used as input in Step2 to calculate the mean radiance.
2. Step2 and Step3: The output 'nightlights2017' from Step2 (calculating mean radiance) is used as input in Step3 to clip the image to the Tanzania boundary.
3. Step3 and Step4: The output 'nightlights2017' from Step3 (clipping to Tanzania boundary) is used as input in Step4 to select the average radiance band.
4. Step4 and Step5: The output 'Image with only the avg_rad band' from Step4 (selecting average radiance band) is used as input in Step5 to add the layer to the map.

These connections illustrate the sequential workflow of the geospatial model, where each step builds upon the output of the previous step.
