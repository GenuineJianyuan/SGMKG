Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (study area geometry) is used as input in Step2 to filter Landsat 8 imagery based on the study area."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (median composite image) is used as input in Step3 to calculate the NDVI index."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3 (NDVI image) is used as input in Step4 to identify corn fields based on a NDVI threshold."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4 (binary image representing corn fields) is used as input in Step5 to visualize the corn fields on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (Iowa geometry) is used as input in Step5 to focus the map on Iowa."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4 (binary image representing corn fields) is used as input in Step6 to calculate the total area of corn fields in Iowa."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (Iowa geometry) is used as input in Step6 to calculate the total area of corn fields within the Iowa geometry."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object in the array represents a connection between a pair of steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the steps.
