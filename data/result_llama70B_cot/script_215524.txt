Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Image object representing the SRTM elevation map' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to reduce the image within the specified region."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Geometry object representing the rectangular region' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to define the region to reduce within."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Dictionary containing the computed maximum pixel value' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to print the result to the console."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. The output from Step1 (Image object) is used as input in Step3 to perform the image reduction.
2. The output from Step2 (Geometry object) is used as input in Step3 to define the region to reduce within.
3. The output from Step3 (Dictionary containing the computed maximum pixel value) is used as input in Step4 to print the result to the console.

Note that there are no direct connections between Step1 and Step2, or between Step2 and Step4, as the outputs from these steps are not directly used as inputs in the subsequent steps.
