Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered image collection containing images from the specified date range', is used as input in Step2 to pre-filter images for less cloudy granules."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Further filtered image collection with less cloudy granules', is used as input in Step3 to apply the cloud and cirrus masking function."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Image collection with clouds and cirrus masked out', is used as input in Step4 to visualize the RGB composite over the Sharqiya Governorate region."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2: The filtered image collection from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to further filter images for less cloudy granules.
2. Step2 and Step3: The pre-filtered image collection from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to apply the cloud and cirrus masking function.
3. Step3 and Step4: The processed image collection with clouds and cirrus masked out from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to visualize the RGB composite over the Sharqiya Governorate region.
