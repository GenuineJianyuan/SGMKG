Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered dataset for the year 2017' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to calculate the total rainfall."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Total rainfall image' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to visualize the total rainfall on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Total rainfall image' from Step2 is used as input in Step4 to calculate the average rainfall over India."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Total rainfall image' from Step2 is used as input in Step5 to export the total rainfall image to Google Drive."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered dataset for the year 2017' from Step1 is used as input in Step6 to export the filtered data to Google Drive."
    }
]
```

These connections are based on the input-output relationships between the steps, as described in the original sequence and step descriptions.
