Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Map centered on the study area' from Step1 is not used as input in Step2. However, Step1 sets the study area, which is used to filter Landsat 8 images in Step2."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Cloud-free Landsat 8 composite image' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to generate a training dataset."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Training dataset' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to train the clustering algorithm."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Trained clusterer' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to cluster the input image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Cloud-free Landsat 8 composite image' from Step2 is used as input in Step5 to cluster the input image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output 'Clustered image' from Step5 is used as input in Step6 to visualize the clustered image on the map."
    }
]
```

Note that I did not connect Step1 to Step3, Step4, Step5, or Step6 because the output of Step1 is not directly used as input in these steps. Similarly, I did not connect Step2 to Step4 or Step6 because the output of Step2 is not directly used as input in these steps.
