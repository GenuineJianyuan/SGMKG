Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Landsat 8 image' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to extract RGB and panchromatic bands."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'RGB image' from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to convert it to HSV color space."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'Panchromatic image' from Step2 is used as input in Step4 to swap in the panchromatic band."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'HSV image' from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to swap in the panchromatic band."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Pansharpened RGB image' from Step4 is used as input in Step5 to display it on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'RGB image' from Step2 is used as input in Step5 to display the original image on the map."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
