Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Processed Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance data', is used as input in Step2 to calculate NDVI and EVI indices."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NDVI and EVI indices', is used as input in Step3 to calculate the Drought Ratio Index (DRI)."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Drought Ratio Index (DRI)', is used as input in Step4 to visualize the DRI on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Drought Ratio Index (DRI)', is used as input in Step5 to export the DRI as a GeoTIFF file."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the processed Sentinel-2 data from Step1 is used to calculate NDVI and EVI indices in Step2.
2. Step2 and Step3 are connected because the NDVI and EVI indices from Step2 are used to calculate the DRI in Step3.
3. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the DRI from Step3 is used to visualize the DRI on the map in Step4.
4. Step3 and Step5 are connected because the DRI from Step3 is used to export the DRI as a GeoTIFF file in Step5.

Note that there are no connections between Step4 and Step5, as they are separate outputs of the DRI calculation in Step3.
