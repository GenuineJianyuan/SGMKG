Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will analyze the combination relationship between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Median composite images for 2000 (Landsat 5)' and 'Median composite images for 2020 (Landsat 8)', is used as input in Step2 to calculate NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI indices."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NDVI images for 2000 and 2020', 'NDWI images for 2000 and 2020', and 'NDBI images for 2000 and 2020', is used as input in Step3 to detect land cover change by comparing indices between 2000 and 2020."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Binary change detection map indicating areas of land cover change', is used as input in Step4 to visualize the land cover change on the map."
    }
]
```

These connections exist because the output of each step is used as input in the subsequent step, as described in the "reason" field of each JSON object.
