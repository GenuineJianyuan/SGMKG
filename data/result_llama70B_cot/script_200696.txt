Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Sentinel-2 images for image_after' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to calculate the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'NBR images image_NBR1' and 'NBR images image_NBR2' from Step2 are used as input in Step3 to visualize the NBR results on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Filtered Sentinel-2 images for image_before' and 'Filtered Sentinel-2 images for image_after' from Step1 are used as input in Step3 to visualize the satellite images on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation for each connection:

1. The output from Step1 (filtered Sentinel-2 images for `image_after`) is used as input in Step2 to calculate the NBR.
2. The output from Step2 (NBR images `image_NBR1` and `image_NBR2`) is used as input in Step3 to visualize the NBR results on the map.
3. The output from Step1 (filtered Sentinel-2 images for `image_before` and `image_after`) is used as input in Step3 to visualize the satellite images on the map.

These connections illustrate the flow of data between the steps, highlighting how the outputs from one step are used as inputs in subsequent steps.
