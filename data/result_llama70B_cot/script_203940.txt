Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered NPP dataset', is used as input in Step2 to filter the data by region."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NPP dataset within the Riau region', is used as input in Step5 to add the clipped NPP layer to the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NPP dataset within the Riau region', is used as input in Step6 to export the clipped NPP image to Google Drive."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Map centered on the Riau region', is used as a prerequisite for Step4 to add the region boundary to the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'Map centered on the Riau region', is used as a prerequisite for Step5 to add the clipped NPP layer to the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step4", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Riau region boundary layer on the map', is used as input in Step7 to add region boundary visualization to the map."
    }
]
```

Note that I only connected steps where there is a clear output-input relationship or a prerequisite relationship.
