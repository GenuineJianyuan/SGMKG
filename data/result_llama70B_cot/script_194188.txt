Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered and processed Landsat 8 image collection', is used as input in Step2 to calculate the NDVI."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NDVI image', is used as input in Step3 to set the map center and add the NDVI layer."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NDVI image', is used as input in Step4 to define the visualization parameters for the NDVI layer."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Visualization parameters for the NDVI layer', is used as input in Step5 to add the NDVI layer with color-coded visualization to the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'NDVI image', is used as input in Step5 to add the NDVI layer with color-coded visualization to the map."
    }
]
```

Each JSON object represents a connection between two steps, with the "relationship" key specifying the step names and the "reason" key explaining the output-input relationship between the two steps.
