Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (ImageCollections s2_before, s2_inTime, s2_after) is used as input in Step2 to calculate NDVI bands."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (ImageCollections s2_before, s2_inTime, s2_after) is used as input in Step3 to calculate NBR bands."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (ImageCollections ndvi_before, ndvi_in, ndvi_after) is used as input in Step4 to visualize NDVI bands on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3 (ImageCollections nbr_before, nbr_in, nbr_after) is used as input in Step4 to visualize NBR bands on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 outputs Sentinel-2 images, which are used as input in Step2 to calculate NDVI bands.
2. Step1 outputs Sentinel-2 images, which are used as input in Step3 to calculate NBR bands.
3. Step2 outputs NDVI bands, which are used as input in Step4 to visualize NDVI bands on the map.
4. Step3 outputs NBR bands, which are used as input in Step4 to visualize NBR bands on the map.

These connections illustrate the data flow between the steps, highlighting how the outputs of one step are used as inputs in subsequent steps.
