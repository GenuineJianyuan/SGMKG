Based on the provided JSON summarization and steps, I will identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the list of connections in a JSON array:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship": ["Step1", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1 (Binary image representing class 10) is used as input in Step4 to merge with other binary images."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2 (Binary image representing class 12) is used as input in Step4 to merge with other binary images."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3 (Binary image representing class 14) is used as input in Step4 to merge with other binary images."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4 (Merged image) is used as input in Step5 to reproject the image."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step5", "Step6"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5 (Reprojected image) is used as input in Step6 to add the image to the map for visualization."
    },
    {
        "relationship": ["Step5", "Step7"],
        "reason": "The output of Step5 (Reprojected image) is used as input in Step7 to export the image to Google Drive as a GeoTIFF file."
    }
]
```

Note that I only connected steps where the output of one step is used as input in another step, as per the instructions.
