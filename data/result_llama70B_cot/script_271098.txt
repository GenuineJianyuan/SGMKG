Here is the JSON array representing the combination relationships between the steps:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output 'Loaded Landsat 8 images' from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to calculate NDSI and threshold."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output 'Loaded Landsat 8 images' from Step1 is used as input in Step3 to separate water from snow."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output 'NDSI image' from Step2 is used as input in Step4 to threshold NDSI for snow-covered pixels."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output 'Boolean image indicating water pixels' from Step3 is used as input in Step5 to replace snow pixels."
    },
    {
