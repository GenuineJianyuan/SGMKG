Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the workflow and identify the combination relationships between the steps. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Landsat image collection', is used as input in Step2 to select the image with the least cloud cover."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Image with the least cloud cover', is used as input in Step3 to calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step3", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step3, 'NDWI image', is used as input in Step4 to visualize the NDWI on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2 are connected because the filtered Landsat image collection output from Step1 is used as input in Step2 to select the image with the least cloud cover.
2. Step2 and Step3 are connected because the image with the least cloud cover output from Step2 is used as input in Step3 to calculate the NDWI.
3. Step3 and Step4 are connected because the NDWI image output from Step3 is used as input in Step4 to visualize the NDWI on the map.

These connections illustrate the sequential workflow of the geospatial model, where each step builds upon the output of the previous step.
