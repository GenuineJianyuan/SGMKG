Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Image containing tree cover data for the year 2000 within the specified region', is used as input in Step2 to calculate the forest area in 2000."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Total forest area in hectares for the year 2000 within the specified region', is used as input in Step3 to print the total tree cover in 2000 meeting specific criteria."
    }
]
```

Note that I did not include a connection between Step3 and Step4, as Step4 is not fully implemented in the provided code snippet. Additionally, I did not find any connection between Step1 and Step4, or Step2 and Step4, as the inputs and outputs do not match.
