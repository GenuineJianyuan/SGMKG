Based on the provided JSON summarization, I will analyze the steps and identify the combination relationships between them. Here is the result:

```json
[
    {
        "relationship":["Step1", "Step2"],
        "reason": "The output of Step1, 'Filtered Landsat 8 ImageCollection for the specified time period', is used as input in Step2 to create a cloud-free composite image."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step3"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Cloud-free composite image', is used as input in Step3 to display the composite images on the map."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step2", "Step4"],
        "reason": "The output of Step2, 'Cloud-free composite image', is used as input in Step4 to clip the composite image to a specific study area polygon."
    },
    {
        "relationship":["Step4", "Step5"],
        "reason": "The output of Step4, 'Clipped composite image', is used as input in Step5 to display the clipped composite image on the map."
    }
]
```

Here's a brief explanation of each connection:

1. Step1 and Step2: The filtered Landsat 8 ImageCollection is used to create a cloud-free composite image.
2. Step2 and Step3: The cloud-free composite image is displayed on the map.
3. Step2 and Step4: The cloud-free composite image is clipped to a specific study area polygon.
4. Step4 and Step5: The clipped composite image is displayed on the map.

Note that there are no connections between Step1 and Step3, Step1 and Step4, Step1 and Step5, Step3 and Step4, or Step3 and Step5, as the outputs of these steps are not used as inputs in the subsequent steps.
