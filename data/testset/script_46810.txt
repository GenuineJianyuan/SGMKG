"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial analysis task that focuses on visualizing various atmospheric parameters over a specific area. The code creates a buffer around a given point, then retrieves and visualizes data from different satellite image collections related to aerosol index, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and total aerosol optical depth. The spatial scope is defined by the buffer around the specified point, and the time scope is set to August 1, 2020, to August 11, 2020, for most datasets. The data sources include the Copernicus Sentinel-5P and ECMWF CAMS NRT image collections.",
