To implement this, the code first calculates the slope using the ee.Terrain.slope() function with the SRTM dataset. Then, it uses the reduceRegion() function to compute the mean slope within the geometry. The functions called to realize this step are ee.Terrain.slope() and reduceRegion(). These functions are called using the GEE API. The input to this step is the SRTM dataset (srtm) and the specified area geometry. The output is a dictionary containing the mean slope value.",
