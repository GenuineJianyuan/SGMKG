"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code focuses on conducting a geo-analysis task within the Amazon Basin region using Google Earth Engine. The code utilizes the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset to calculate and visualize various vegetation indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index). The purpose of this script is to analyze the vegetation dynamics in the Amazon Basin region over time and visualize the results using different color palettes.",
