"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to calculate the mean value of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) over the Riau region. It utilizes the MODIS dataset to filter NPP data from 2001 to 2021 within the specified region. The script then clips the NPP data to the boundary of the Riau region, adds the clipped layer to the map, and exports the result as an image to Google Drive. Additionally, it visualizes the region on the map.",
