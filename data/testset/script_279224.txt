"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process using Google Earth Engine to classify land cover in Myanmar. The code first loads Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for the year 2019 and a feature collection of labeled examples. It then filters the imagery based on cloud cover percentage, calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), samples regions for training data, trains a Random Forest classifier, and finally classifies the imagery into different land cover classes.",
