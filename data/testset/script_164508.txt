"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to analyze the NO2 values in Italy for the months of February to May in the years 2019 and 2020. It first filters the country boundary of Italy from a global feature collection, then imports the NO2 values from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P dataset. The code filters the NO2 values for the specified months and years, calculates the average, multiplies by a factor, and clips the data to the extent of Italy. Finally, it visualizes the NO2 values for 2019 and 2020 on the map.",
