"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that aims to analyze water quality using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The script filters Sentinel-2 data for a specific time period (from May 7, 2020, to May 12, 2020) and within a defined geographical boundary. It calculates the Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) to assess water quality, visualizes the results, and displays them on the map. The code also includes functions for masking clouds and defining color palettes for visualization.",
