"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process using Google Earth Engine to classify land cover types in Nebraska based on Landsat 5 imagery from 2012. The code first calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and adds it as a new band to the Landsat 5 image. It then limits the training data to a specific feature collection (irrigated areas), remaps the classes, samples the data, and trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, it classifies the Landsat image using the trained classifier and visualizes the results on the map.",

This is achieved by first normalizing the difference between bands 4 and 3 to calculate NDVI. The band is then renamed as 'NDVI', band 6 is divided by 300, and both NDVI and band 6 are added as new bands to the image.",
