"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to conduct a geo-analysis task focusing on surface soil moisture in the northeastern provinces of China. The code loads Landsat 8 data and calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the specified time range. It also loads and filters soil moisture data from the NASA SMAP 10km dataset. The NDVI and soil moisture data are then clipped to the boundaries of the northeastern provinces and visualized on the map.",
