"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code demonstrates the process of HSV-based Pan-Sharpening using Google Earth Engine. It retrieves a Landsat 8 image, extracts the RGB and panchromatic bands, converts the RGB image to HSV, swaps in the panchromatic band, and converts it back to RGB. The code then displays the original RGB image and the pansharpened image on the map.",
