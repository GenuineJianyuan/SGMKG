"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to detect corn fields in the state of Iowa using Landsat 8 imagery. It sets the study area to Iowa, specifies a time range, loads Landsat 8 images, calculates the NDVI index, identifies corn fields based on a NDVI threshold, visualizes the corn fields on the map, calculates the total area of corn fields in Iowa, and prints the result.",
