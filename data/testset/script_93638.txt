"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a solution for detecting center-pivot irrigation systems using Google Earth Engine. It utilizes edge detection techniques and convolution with a ring kernel to highlight areas that match the characteristics of center-pivot irrigation systems. The code loads a Landsat EVI image, applies a threshold to identify areas of interest, detects edges using the Canny edge detector, creates a ring kernel, convolves the edge detection result with the ring kernel, and finally highlights the detected center-pivot irrigation systems on the map.",
