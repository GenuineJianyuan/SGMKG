"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial analysis script using Google Earth Engine to analyze snow cover using Landsat satellite imagery. The script filters Landsat images based on a specific geometry and time range, calculates the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for each image, and then creates a minimum composite for three different years (2014, 2018, and 2022). Finally, it visualizes the results on the map by adding layers for each year.",
