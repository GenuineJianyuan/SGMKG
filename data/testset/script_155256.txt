"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process using Google Earth Engine to perform clustering analysis on Landsat satellite imagery. The code loads a Landsat image for the year 2001, defines a region of interest, samples the image within that region, trains a KMeans clustering algorithm on the sampled data, and then applies the trained model to cluster the entire image. The resulting clusters are visualized on the map with random colors.",
