"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to replace snow-covered pixels in one Landsat 8 image with snow-free pixels from another Landsat 8 image. The script first loads two Landsat 8 images, one with snow cover and one without. It then calculates the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and thresholds it at 0.35 to identify snow-covered pixels. Additionally, it separates water from snow using the Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance at 0.2. The script then uses the '.where()' function to replace the snow pixels in the snow-covered image with the corresponding pixels from the snow-free image. Finally, it visualizes the original snow-free image, the original snow-covered image, the replaced image, the NDSI thresholded image, and the NIR reflectance thresholded image on the map.",
