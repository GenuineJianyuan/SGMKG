"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that focuses on analyzing Landsat satellite imagery over a specific region in India. The code filters Landsat imagery based on location and date, calculates the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) for the selected image, and visualizes the NDWI results on a map.",
