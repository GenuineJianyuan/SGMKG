"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial analysis task that focuses on calculating the difference in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between two Landsat 5 images taken 20 years apart. The code loads the two images, computes NDVI for each image, calculates the difference in NDVI, applies a land mask from the SRTM DEM to the difference, and finally displays the masked NDVI difference on the map.",
