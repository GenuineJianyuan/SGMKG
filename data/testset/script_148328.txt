"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to analyze forest cover changes in Finland between 2000 and 2020 using Google Earth Engine. It first creates a polygon representing Finland, then retrieves tree cover, forest loss, and forest gain data from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset. The script calculates the area of tree cover, forest loss, and forest gain in square kilometers within the Finland polygon. Finally, it prints out the results of tree cover in 2000, forest loss between 2000 and 2020, and forest gain between 2000 and 2020.",
