"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a solution for a carbon storage impact analysis using geospatial data. The code imports MODIS GPP and NPP data, precipitation data, and soil data. It sets a specific time range and spatial extent over Germany. The code aggregates and clips the data, visualizes the layers on the map, combines the datasets, and performs a linear regression analysis to understand the relationship between GPP, NPP, precipitation, soil texture, and carbon storage. The results of the linear regression are printed for interpretation.",
