"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code focuses on conducting a geo-analysis task on the Peninsula region using Google Earth Engine. The code first defines the region of interest, filters Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data, applies edge detection kernels (Gaussian and Laplacian), and visualizes the results on the map. The purpose of this script is to identify edges and boundaries within the satellite imagery of the Peninsula region.",
