"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to analyze land cover change in the Beijing region between the years 2000 and 2020 using Landsat satellite imagery. The script loads Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images for the respective years, calculates NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI indices, sets thresholds for change detection, compares the indices between the two years, and creates a binary change detection map. The final output is a visualization of land cover change on the map.",
