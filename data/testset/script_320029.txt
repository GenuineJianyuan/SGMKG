"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to detect crop growth in France by combining three different datasets: Leaf Area Index (LAI) from MODIS, temperature from ERA5, and precipitation from CHIRPS. The code loads these datasets, applies weights to each based on their importance in crop growth, combines them to create a composite index, and visualizes the result on a map.",
