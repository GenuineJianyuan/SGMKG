"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that focuses on Landsat 8 imagery. The code first defines functions to mask clouds and perform pan-sharpening on Landsat 8 images. It then creates a composite image by filtering Landsat 8 TOA data for a specific time period, applying the masking and pan-sharpening functions, and taking the median. Finally, it visualizes the original and pan-sharpened images on the map.",
