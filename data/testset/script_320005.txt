"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code performs a flood analysis in the study area of Poyang Lake using Landsat satellite imagery. The code first selects the study area, then filters Landsat images for two periods (winter and summer), calculates the difference in water extent between the two periods, visualizes the flooded areas, computes the total flooded area, and finally prints out the total flooded area in square kilometers.",
