"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to upsample MODIS landcover classification data (250m resolution) to Landsat resolution (30m) using a supervised classifier. The script loads MODIS landcover data for Egypt, filters Landsat data, creates a composite image, samples training data, trains a classifier, and applies it to the Landsat composite to generate an upsampled landcover image.",
