"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a solution for a specific geo-analysis task that involves masking out clouds and cirrus from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery over the Sharqiya Governorate region. The code filters Sentinel-2 images from a specific date range in 2020, applies a cloud masking function to remove cloudy pixels, and then visualizes the RGB composite of the processed images over the Sharqiya Governorate boundary.",

This step implements by using the `filterDate` function with the parameters '2020-01-11' and '2020-01-21' to select images within the specified date range.

This step defines a function `maskS2clouds` to mask out clouds and cirrus, and then maps this function over the image collection.
