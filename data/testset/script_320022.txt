"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code performs array-based spectral unmixing using Landsat 5 images from June through September 2007. It creates a mosaic of Landsat 5 images, selects specific bands, computes representative endmembers, calculates the pseudo inverse, and then unmixes the image to show the fractions of urban, vegetation, and water. The final result is displayed as a colored image on the map.",

This is achieved by using the ee.ImageCollection() function to create a collection of Landsat 5 images, then filtering the images by date range using the filterDate() function. Specific bands are selected using the select() function, and the median value for each pixel is computed using the median() function. The sequence of operations includes filtering images by date, selecting specific bands, and computing the median value.",
