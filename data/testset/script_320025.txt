"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code performs an unsupervised classification using Landsat satellite imagery. It loads a Landsat composite image for the year 2001, defines a region of interest, creates a training dataset by sampling the input image, trains a KMeans clusterer using the training data, and then applies the trained clusterer to cluster the input image. The resulting clusters are displayed on the map with random colors.",
