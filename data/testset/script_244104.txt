"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process using Google Earth Engine to analyze burned areas in Bolivia for the year 2001. It filters MODIS satellite data for the specified time frame and selects the 'BurnDate' band. The code then calculates the mean burned area for the year 2001, clips it to the extent of Bolivia, reprojects it, adds it to the map visualization, and exports it as an image to Google Drive.",
