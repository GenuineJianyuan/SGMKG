"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to perform Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change analysis using the Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) method. The script loads Landsat 8 satellite imagery, preprocesses the data by creating a cloud-free composite, segments the image using the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm, prepares training samples by sampling regions based on predefined land cover classes, trains a Random Forest classifier, classifies the segmented image, and visualizes the LULC classification results.",
