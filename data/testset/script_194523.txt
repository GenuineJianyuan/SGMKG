"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is designed to perform a geo-analysis task focusing on the Yili region in China using Landsat satellite imagery. The script filters Landsat 8 images from July to August 2013, creates a composite image, calculates the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to identify water bodies, masks out non-water areas, classifies water and ice based on elevation from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and exports the water image to Google Drive. The final output includes visualizations of the data layers on the map.",
