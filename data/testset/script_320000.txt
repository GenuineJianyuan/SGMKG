"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code utilizes the Canny Edge Detector algorithm to detect edges in a Landsat image. It first loads a Landsat image, computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from it, then applies the Canny Edge Detector algorithm to the NDVI image. The resulting edges are displayed on the map along with the NDVI image.",
