"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code demonstrates a geospatial analysis task of finding linear features using the Hough Transform algorithm. The code loads a Landsat image, computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), applies a Canny edge detector to detect edges in the NDVI image, and then performs the Hough Transform to identify linear features. The results are displayed on a map, showing the original image, the Canny edge detection result, and the Hough transform result.",
