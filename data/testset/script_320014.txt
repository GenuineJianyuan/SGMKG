"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that calculates the Leaf Area Index (LAI) for a specific region (in this case, the San Francisco Bay Area) using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The code filters Landsat 8 images based on a defined region of interest (ROI) and a specific date range. It then calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the selected Landsat image and uses this to compute the LAI. The LAI values are visualized on a map and the mean and standard deviation statistics are printed for the LAI image within the ROI.",
