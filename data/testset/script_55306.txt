"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to perform a geospatial analysis task using Google Earth Engine. The code starts by defining a study area and centering the map on it. It then creates a cloud-free Landsat 8 composite image for a specific date range within the study area. The script samples the image to create a training dataset, then uses a clustering algorithm (Weka KMeans) to cluster the pixels in the image. Finally, it visualizes the clustered image on the map.",
