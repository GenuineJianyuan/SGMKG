"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that aims to analyze aboveground biomass carbon density in a specific region (Hatay). The code utilizes the NASA/ORNL biomass carbon density dataset to calculate the mean aboveground biomass carbon density within the specified region. It then visualizes the results on a map and exports the image to Google Drive. Additionally, the code computes statistics such as mean and standard deviation of biomass carbon density within the study area and prints them to the console.",
