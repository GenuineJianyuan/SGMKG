"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to analyze land use cover change in the Beijing region using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The code defines the geographic boundary of Beijing, sets time ranges for 2020 and 2021, loads Landsat 8 image collection, calculates NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), filters and composites images for 2020 and 2021, computes NDVI difference between the two years, visualizes the NDVI difference on the map, and sets the map center to Beijing.",
