"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a solution for a geo-analysis task that aims to create a quality mosaic of Landsat imagery for the year 2000, specifically focusing on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of bands 4 and 3. The code first loads Landsat 7 imagery for the year 2000, calculates the NDVI, and then creates a quality mosaic by sorting the pixels based on the NDVI values. The final output is a visualization of the greenest pixels from the year 2000.",

The code uses the ee.ImageCollection() function to load the Landsat 7 imagery, then filters the images by date using the filterDate() function. Next, it calculates the NDVI using bands 4 and 3 with the normalizedDifference() function and adds the NDVI as a new band to each image with the addBands() function.",
