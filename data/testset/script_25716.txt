"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process using Google Earth Engine to classify cropland in a specific region based on Landsat imagery and manually created training polygons. The script loads an image, defines bands for prediction, creates a FeatureCollection of training polygons, samples pixel values within these polygons, trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, classifies the image, and displays the results on a map.",
