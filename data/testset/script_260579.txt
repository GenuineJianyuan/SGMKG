"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to perform a geospatial analysis task using Google Earth Engine. The task involves sampling sea surface temperature (SST) data from a specific region of interest, interpolating the temperature values using Kriging, and visualizing the results on a map. The code utilizes the 'NOAA/AVHRR_Pathfinder_V52_L3' dataset for SST data, selects the 'sea_surface_temperature' band, normalizes the values, samples 1000 random locations within a defined geometry, performs Kriging interpolation with specified parameters, and finally visualizes the interpolated SST values alongside the original SST layer and sample points on a map.",
