"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process for landslide detection using Google Earth Engine. It involves remapping land cover classes, calculating NDVI, analyzing slope, categorizing slope, and combining these factors to create a final result for landslide detection. Landsat imagery, SRTM Digital Elevation Model data, and a boundary region are used as input data sources for the analysis.",
