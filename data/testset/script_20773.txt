"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that aims to classify land cover types in the Porto Seguro region using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The code first loads the shape of Porto Seguro and the Sentinel-2 image collection for a specific time period with low cloud cover. It then creates a training dataset by merging multiple land cover classes, samples regions from the Sentinel-2 image based on the training dataset, trains a classification model using the training data, and finally classifies the image into different land cover classes.",
