"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial analysis workflow that aims to find the least cloudy Landsat 8 image in 2015 for a specific point of interest. It then calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for that image and displays the result on a map. The code imports Landsat 8 TOA image collection, filters the images based on location and date, selects the least cloudy image, calculates NDVI using the NIR and red bands, and finally displays the NDVI image on the map.",
