"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling process that focuses on analyzing climate data for Kenya for the year 1981 using the TerraClimate dataset. The code imports a shapefile of Kenya, filters the TerraClimate dataset for the year 1981, selects specific climate variables, calculates the average temperature, joins it to the image as a new band, masks out zero values, displays the image on the map, and exports the final image to Google Drive.",

The functions involved include importing a shapefile, filtering an image collection by date, and selecting specific bands. To implement this step, the code imports the Kenya shapefile as a FeatureCollection, filters the TerraClimate dataset for the year 1981, and selects the 'pdsi', 'soil', 'tmmn', 'tmmx' bands. The functions used are ee.FeatureCollection.load() to import the shapefile, ee.ImageCollection.filterDate() to filter by date, and ee.Image.select() to select specific bands.",
