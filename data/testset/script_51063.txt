"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to calculate the total tree cover in the year 2000 within a specified region, as well as the tree cover loss from 2001 to 2020. It utilizes the Global Forest Change dataset to extract tree cover information and performs calculations to determine the total forest area in the year 2000. The code then proceeds to calculate the tree cover loss over the specified time period.",
