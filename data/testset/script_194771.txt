"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to perform a geo-analysis task using Google Earth Engine. The task involves selecting specific land cover classes from the MODIS dataset for the year 2020, merging them, reprojecting the final image, and exporting it to Google Drive as a GeoTIFF file. The spatial scope is defined by a polygon geometry, and the time scope is limited to the year 2020. The main data source is the MODIS land cover dataset.",
