"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code demonstrates the use of the `reduceRegion` function in Google Earth Engine to compute a simple reduction over a specified region of an image. The task involves finding the maximum pixel value within a given region of an SRTM elevation map. The code defines the input image, specifies the region of interest, and then reduces the image within that region to calculate the maximum pixel value. The result is printed to the console as a dictionary.",
