"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to analyze forest change by comparing two datasets, FORMA 500 and Hansen et al., for the year 2012. The code converts dates to seconds, defines a region of interest, loads the FORMA and Hansen datasets, creates binary layers based on specific dates, and generates an image showing deforestation where both datasets indicate loss in 2012. The final output is a map displaying the areas of deforestation in yellow color.",
