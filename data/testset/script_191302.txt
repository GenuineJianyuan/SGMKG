"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling script that processes Landsat 8 satellite imagery within a specific area of interest (AOI) and time frame. It filters the Landsat image collection based on date and cloud cover percentage, applies scaling factors to the optical and thermal bands, and visualizes the true color composite image. The final output is a map layer showing the true color composite image centered on a specific location.",
