"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial modeling script using Google Earth Engine to analyze Sentinel-1 SAR data. The script focuses on filtering and processing SAR data for a specific region of interest (ROI) in Thailand. It filters the Sentinel-1 Image Collection for VH polarization, selects images within a certain date range, clips the data to the ROI, and then exports the processed image to Google Drive.",
