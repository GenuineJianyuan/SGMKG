"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to perform a geo-analysis task using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The task involves masking out cloud and cloud shadow pixels from Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance imagery within a specific region of interest (ROI) defined by a given feature collection. The code filters the Landsat 8 imagery based on a date range and cloud cover percentage, clips the images to the ROI, applies a cloud masking function, and then visualizes the processed imagery on the map.",

The code uses the `filterDate` function to select Landsat 8 imagery from January 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020. It then applies the `filterMetadata` function to filter out images with a cloud cover percentage less than 5.",
