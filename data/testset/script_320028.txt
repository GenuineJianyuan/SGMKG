"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to detect corn areas in a specific region in India using MODIS land cover data. The code first sets the study area to a rectangle covering India, then loads the MODIS land cover dataset for the year 2020. It selects the 'LC_Type1' band from the dataset and clips it to the India region. The code identifies corn areas by comparing the land cover type to a specific value representing corn fields. It visualizes the corn areas on the map and calculates the total corn field area in the India region.",
