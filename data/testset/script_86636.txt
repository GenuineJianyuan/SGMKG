"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code is a geospatial analysis workflow using Google Earth Engine to analyze surface water occurrence and transition classes within a specified region of interest. The code loads the Global Surface Water dataset, selects the 'occurrence' and 'transition' bands, calculates the pixel area with transition classes, reduces the pixel values within the region of interest, and exports the transition classes image to Google Drive. The spatial scope is the Mekong River Basin in Southeast Asia, and the time scope is from 1984 to 2015.",
