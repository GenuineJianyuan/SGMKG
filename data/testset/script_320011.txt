"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code performs an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation on methane data collected by the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. The code imports two weeks of methane data, creates a composite by taking the mean, samples the data within a defined area of interest, calculates the global mean and standard deviation of methane concentrations, and then performs IDW interpolation to estimate methane concentrations across the study area. Finally, the interpolated methane data is visualized on a map.",
