"Code summarization": "This JavaScript code aims to perform a geo-analysis task focusing on Thailand using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The script filters Landsat 8 images by date, cloud cover, and location within Thailand. It calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the selected bands (NIR and RED) and visualizes the NDVI on the map. The final output is a color-coded NDVI map of Thailand.",
