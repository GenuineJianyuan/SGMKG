# Project: Design and Application of a Semantic-driven Geospatial Modeling Knowledge Graph (S-GMKG) Based on Large Language Models

## Requirements
- GPT-4o-mini key
- `BAAI/bge-m3`
- Other Python package: 

## Folder Structure

- **data_preparation**  
  Contains methods for initializing geoprocessing scripts and preparing for KG generation.

- **kg_generation**  
  Includes files for the construction of the knowledge graph in three stages: raw KG, canonical KG, and augmented KG.

- **data**  
  Provides sample datasets, intermediate results, and final testing results using the proposed extraction method.

## Note
Due to the large size of the complete S-GMKG database, please contact [jliang@whu.edu.cn](mailto:jliang@whu.edu.cn) for access.
